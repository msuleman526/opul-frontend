## Payment Flow

### For Client (User):
1. **Access Payment**: Click "ðŸ’³ Pay Driver" button in chat
2. **View Calculation**: See breakdown of costs:
   - Hourly Rate: $X/hour
   - Duration: Y hours
   - Base Amount: $X Ã— Y
   - Tip (10%): $(X Ã— Y Ã— 0.10)
   - **Total**: $(X Ã— Y Ã— 1.10)
3. **Choose Payment Method**: PayPal or Stripe
4. **Complete Payment**: Redirected to payment processor
5. **Confirmation**: Return to chat with success message

### For Driver:
1. **Receive Notification**: Real-time popup showing payment received
2. **Payment Details**: 
   - Base amount earned
   - Tip amount (10%)
   - Total amount to be received
3. **Confirmation Message**: "You will receive $XX.XX from Opul within 24 hours"
4. **Chat Update**: System message confirming payment

## Example Calculation

**Scenario**: 3-hour ride, driver hourly rate $20

```
Hourly Rate: $20
Duration: 3 hours
Base Amount: $20 Ã— 3 = $60.00
Tip (10%): $60.00 Ã— 0.10 = $6.00
Total Amount: $60.00 + $6.00 = $66.00
```

**Result**: 
- Client pays: $66.00
- Driver receives: $66.00
- Opul fee: $0 (direct payment to driver)

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Backend Running**: `npm start` in opul-backend
2. **Frontend Accessible**: Open `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Test Data**: Create ride request with matched driver

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Payment Flow
1. **Setup**: 
   - Create ride request (any duration)
   - Have driver accept the ride
   - Both users join chat: 
     - Client: `Chat.html?requestId=RID123&userType=user`
     - Driver: `Chat.html?requestId=RID123&userType=driver`

2. **Client Actions**:
   - See "ðŸ’³ Pay Driver" button in chat header
   - Click button to open payment modal
   - Verify calculation is correct: `(rate Ã— hours) + 10%`
   - Click "Pay with Stripe" or "Pay with PayPal"
   - Complete payment on external site
   - Return to chat and see success message

3. **Driver Actions**:
   - Receive real-time payment notification popup
   - See detailed payment breakdown in popup
   - See system message in chat: "ðŸ’° Payment received! You will get $XX.XX from Opul."
   - Hear success sound notification

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Payment Attempts
1. **Test Error Handling**: Cancel payment and try again
2. **Payment Method Switching**: Try both PayPal and Stripe
3. **Network Issues**: Test with poor connectivity

### Test Scenario 3: Edge Cases
1. **Driver Offline**: Payment should still work, driver gets notification when online
2. **Chat Reload**: Payment button should remain hidden after successful payment
3. **Multiple Rides**: Each ride should have independent payment capability
