Project Title: Opul

1. User Flow & State Management

Two roles: Client (Rider) and Driver.

Client Flow (new order):

Ride Request Form (Home Page):

Enter pickup location.

Enter approximate ride duration.

Submit request.

Redirect to Payment Page:

Must pay an upfront, non-refundable fee (via PayPal or other).

Request becomes active and visible to drivers.

If not paid within 5 minutes or Client cancels → request is deleted.

State handling:

Request status = pending, active, expired, cancelled, or completed.

Timer logic: auto-remove unconfirmed requests after 5 minutes.

2. Driver Side Workflow

Drivers see only active (paid) and pending requests.

For each request, driver can:

View pickup area, ride duration, and vehicle type needed (if provided).

Click Offer Ride/Contract.

If Client cancels or request expires → request should disappear from driver’s dashboard in real-time.

3. Payment Integration

Payment via PayPal Checkout (React SDK).

If payment successful → mark request as active.

If payment fails or times out → mark request as expired and remove from system.

Credits system: upfront fee is stored for future rides if unused.

4. Ride Acceptance & Matching

After payment, available drivers appear on Client’s screen.

Client sees:

Driver vehicle type (sedan, SUV, truck).

Hourly rate.

Client clicks Accept Ride → moves both Client & Driver into chat room.

5. Chat System

Real-time chat between Client & Driver.

Auto-greeting from Driver: “Thanks for your trust, I’m on my way. Please share exact pickup location.”

Chat persists until ride is ended.

Contract status = in-progress or completed.

Time logging enabled for contract duration.

Also allow client to pay driver through the app with a 10% cut for opul.


6. Logging & Profiles

Driver profiles: show past rides, payments, contracts.

Client: no login required, no ride history (simplified flow).

7. Expiry & Cancellation Rules

If Client does not pay upfront fee within 5 minutes → request auto-deleted.

If Client cancels before paying → request deleted.

If Client cancels after paying → fee is non-refundable, marked as credit.

Drivers get real-time updates when request is removed.
